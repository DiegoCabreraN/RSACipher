# RSA Cipher

## What is it?

This project is a program developed to encrypt/decrypt a string using the algorithm [RSA](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA). Of course, it uses small prime numbers in order to compute a simple string, but it can be used for larger primes too.

## How can I use it?

Simply download the repo, make sure you have python 3 installed on your system, and execute the command you want to use:

- `python app.py --encrypt="Hello world"`
- `python app.py --decrypt=HUll@zw@Ml8`
